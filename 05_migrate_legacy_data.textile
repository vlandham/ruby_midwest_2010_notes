** don't use non utf8 databases in rails 

h3. Using Java to help migration

* access database? | mssql
* JDBC adapters 
** much more plentiful 

h3. MSSQL example

* download mssql driver
* copy sqljdbc4.jar into RAILS_ROOT/lib
* add require 'lib/sqljdbc4'
* add configuration to database
* jdbc driver is uniform 
* data mapper - used a lot
** don't have to use data mapper in  your app to take advantage of the migration capabilities
